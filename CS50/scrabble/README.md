### Scrabble

A two players game, each enter their word, and the higher scoring player wins. Players create words to score points, and the number of points is the sum of the point values of each letter in the word.
The program prompts the two players for their words and computes, using an array which includes the letter points, and return the score for the string argument. Characters that are not letters give zero points, and uppercase and lowercase give the same point values. We take advantage of the ASCII values.
