            <p>You start by ckecking again your log files. The next passage seems promising:
               <br>
               <q>The theft of the CS50 duck took place at <b>10:15am</b> at the Humphrey Street bakery.
               Interviews were conducted today with <b>three witnesses</b> who were present at the time.
               Each of their interview transcripts mentions <b>the bakery</b>.</q>
               <br>
               You find them to get their side of story.
            </p>
            <h3 style="background-color:rgb(153, 204, 255)"><center>Interviews</center></h3>
            <p>
               <q>Sometime <b>within ten minutes</b> of the theft, I saw the thief get into a car in the bakery parking lot and <b>drive away</b>.
               If you have security footage from the bakery parking lot, you might want to look for cars that left the parking lot in that time frame.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I don't know the thief's name, but it was someone I recognized. Earlier this morning, before I arrived at Emma's bakery
               I was walking by <b>the ATM on Leggett Street</b> and saw the thief there withdrawing some money.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>As the thief was leaving the bakery, they <b>called someone</b> who talked to them for <b>less than a minute</b>.
               In the call, I heard the thief say that they were planning to take the <b>earliest flight out of Fiftyville tomorrow</b>.
               The thief then asked the person on the other end of the phone to purchase the flight ticket.</q>
