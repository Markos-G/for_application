### Credit Card

The credit card numbers have some structure to them.
- All American Express numbers start with 34 or 37
- MasterCard numbers start with 51, 52, 53, 54, or 55
- all Visa numbers start with 4. 

We code the algorithm invented by Hans Peter Luhn of IBM (Luhnâ€™s algorithm) to first determine if a credit card number is (syntactically) valid as follows, and proceed to list the company name for each card.
