### Sort

There are three already-compiled C programs, sort1, sort2, and sort3. Each of these programs implements a different sorting algorithm: selection sort, bubble sort, or merge sort. We determine which sorting algorithm is used by each file, considing how each algorithm performs with an already sorted list, a reversed list, or a shuffled list based on the Big O notation of each of the algorithms.
