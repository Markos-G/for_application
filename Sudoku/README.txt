The file sudoku.py contains the impementation of algorithm X,
which is the actual solution of any sudoku grid.
It is accompanied my a .pdf file where the whole process is written.



The other files are for a site where
from a database of 1_000_000 sudokus it generates one 
and the user can solve it.
For site:
